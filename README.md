Support / Feedback
==================

For issues with, questions about, or feedback for the MongoDB Java driver, please look into
our [support channels](http://www.mongodb.org/about/support). Please
do not email any of the Java driver developers directly with issues or
questions - you're more likely to get an answer on the [mongodb-user]
(http://groups.google.com/group/mongodb-user) list on Google Groups.

At a minimum, please include in your description the exact version of the driver that you are using.  If you are having 
connectivity issues, it's often also useful to paste in the line of code where you construct the MongoClient instance,
along with the values of all parameters that you pass to the constructor. You should also check your application logs for
any connectivity-related exceptions and post those as well.

=======================

Think you’ve found a bug? Want to see a new feature in the Java driver? Please open a

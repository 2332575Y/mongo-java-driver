ISSUES
 X mark as partial
 - count
 - binary
 X reflection API
 - is DBBase.setReadOnly supposed to take a Boolean?
 - there's no way to create a capped collection, other than using a database command
 - DBApiLayer.getRootNamespaces() unimplemented on purpose?

Interesting stuff:
        o.put( "$where", "eval( true )" ); isn't supported yet, but o.put( "$where", 5 ); isn't counted as a $where clause (because 5 isn't a string) so it is supported.
